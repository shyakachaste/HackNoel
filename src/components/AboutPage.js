       HackNoel is an end-of-year hackathon hosted by Youth Code Camp. It brings together students from high schools across Rwanda. These students will work on their projects, creating web apps, mobile apps, chatbots, and solutions involving IoT and AI to address challenges in healthcare, education, and community services.
